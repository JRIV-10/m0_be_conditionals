# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code? 
It is useful to use a `conditional` when you have a variety of inputs and need different outputs depending on which input is chosen. 

1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would focus more on the foundation that i have established in this topic. I feel i second guessed my answers more than i should have. 

1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why? I am happy with how i responded to the new homework style. Before it was mainly just typing and answering a couple of questions. I was intimidated at first but quickly made a plan and was able to finish faster than i expected.
